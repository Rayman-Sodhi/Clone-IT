            Can external participants join a call?</h1>
            <p class="external-p">Absolutely. In fact, you can share the same link with all meeting participants, making it easier to get everyone you need on the call.</p>
    </div >
    <div class="install-part">
        <h1 class="install-h">Do I need to install anything?</h1>
        <p class="install-p"> For users on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and new Edge we don't require or ask for any plugins or software to be installed, Meet works entirely in the browser. This limits the attack surface for Meet and the need to push out frequent security patches on end-user machines. On mobile, we recommend that you install the Meet or Gmail app from Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.

<section class="third-party-sec">
    <h1 class="third-party-h">Is a third-party service required for dial-in access?</h1>
    <p class="third-party-p"> No. With Google Workspace , you have the ability to include a phone number and PIN on each of your meetings with no other configuration required. Check the dial-in documentation for further details.
